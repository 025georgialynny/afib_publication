# Complete implementation of Pan-Tompkins algorithm

# Translated to Python 3.6 and adapted by Drew Johnston

## Inputs
# ecg : raw ecg vector signal 1d signal
# fs : sampling frequency e.g. 200Hz, 400Hz and etc
# gr : flag to plot or not plot 

## Outputs
# qrs_amp_raw : amplitude of R waves amplitudes
# qrs_i_raw : index of R waves
# delay : number of samples which the signal is delayed due to the filtering

## Method :

## PreProcessing
# 1) Signal is preprocessed , if the sampling frequency is higher then it is downsampled
# and if it is lower upsampled to make the sampling frequency 200 Hz
# with the same filtering setups introduced in Pan
# tompkins paper (a combination of low pass and high pass filter 5-15 Hz)
# to get rid of the baseline wander and muscle noise. 

# 2) The filtered signal
# is derivated using a derivating filter to high light the QRS complex.

# 3) Signal is squared.

# 4) Signal is averaged with a moving window to get rid
# of noise (0.150 seconds length).

# 5) depending on the sampling frequency of your signal the filtering
# options are changed to best match the characteristics of your ecg signal

# 6) Unlike the other implementations in this implementation the desicion
# rule of the Pan tompkins is implemented completely.

## Decision Rule 
# At this point in the algorithm, the preceding stages have produced a roughly pulse-shaped
# waveform at the output of the MWI . The determination as to whether this pulse
# corresponds to a QRS complex (as opposed to a high-sloped T-wave or a noise artefact) is
# performed with an adaptive thresholding operation and other decision
# rules outlined below

# a) FIDUCIAL MARK - The waveform is first processed to produce a set of weighted unit
# samples at the location of the MWI maxima. This is done in order to localize the QRS
# complex to a single instant of time. The w[k] weighting is the maxima value.

# b) THRESHOLDING - When analyzing the amplitude of the MWI output, the algorithm uses
# two threshold values (THR_SIG and THR_NOISE, appropriately initialized during a brief
# 2 second training phase) that continuously adapt to changing ECG signal quality. The
# first pass through y[n] uses these thresholds to classify the each non-zero sample
# (CURRENTPEAK) as either signal or noise:
# If CURRENTPEAK > THR_SIG, that location is identified as a �QRS complex
# candidate� and the signal level (SIG_LEV) is updated:
# SIG _ LEV = 0.125 �CURRENTPEAK + 0.875� SIG _ LEV

# If THR_NOISE < CURRENTPEAK < THR_SIG, then that location is identified as a
# �noise peak� and the noise level (NOISE_LEV) is updated:
# NOISE _ LEV = 0.125�CURRENTPEAK + 0.875� NOISE _ LEV
# Based on new estimates of the signal and noise levels (SIG_LEV and NOISE_LEV,
# respectively) at that point in the ECG, the thresholds are adjusted as follows:
# THR _ SIG = NOISE _ LEV + 0.25 � (SIG _ LEV ? NOISE _ LEV )
# THR _ NOISE = 0.5� (THR _ SIG)
# These adjustments lower the threshold gradually in signal segments that are deemed to
# be of poorer quality.


# c) SEARCHBACK FOR MISSED QRS COMPLEXES - In the thresholding step above, if
# CURRENTPEAK < THR_SIG, the peak is deemed not to have resulted from a QRS
# complex. If however, an unreasonably long period has expired without an abovethreshold
# peak, the algorithm will assume a QRS has been missed and perform a
# searchback. This limits the number of false negatives. The minimum time used to trigger
# a searchback is 1.66 times the current R peak to R peak time period (called the RR
# interval). This value has a physiological origin - the time value between adjacent
# heartbeats cannot change more quickly than this. The missed QRS complex is assumed
# to occur at the location of the highest peak in the interval that lies between THR_SIG and
# THR_NOISE. In this algorithm, two average RR intervals are stored,the first RR interval is 
# calculated as an average of the last eight QRS locations in order to adapt to changing heart 
# rate and the second RR interval mean is the mean 
# of the most regular RR intervals . The threshold is lowered if the heart rate is not regular 
# to improve detection.

# d) ELIMINATION OF MULTIPLE DETECTIONS WITHIN REFRACTORY PERIOD - It is
# impossible for a legitimate QRS complex to occur if it lies within 200ms after a previously
# detected one. This constraint is a physiological one � due to the refractory period during
# which ventricular depolarization cannot occur despite a stimulus[1]. As QRS complex
# candidates are generated, the algorithm eliminates such physically impossible events,
# thereby reducing false positives.

# e) T WAVE DISCRIMINATION - Finally, if a QRS candidate occurs after the 200ms
# refractory period but within 360ms of the previous QRS, the algorithm determines
# whether this is a genuine QRS complex of the next heartbeat or an abnormally prominent
# T wave. This decision is based on the mean slope of the waveform at that position. A slope of
# less than one half that of the previous QRS complex is consistent with the slower
# changing behaviour of a T wave � otherwise, it becomes a QRS detection.
# Extra concept : beside the points mentioned in the paper, this code also
# checks if the occured peak which is less than 360 msec latency has also a
# latency less than 0,5*mean_RR if yes this is counted as noise

# f) In the final stage , the output of R waves detected in smoothed signal is analyzed and double
# checked with the help of the output of the bandpass signal to improve
# detection and find the original index of the real R waves on the raw ecg
# signal
